# Colorful Chat

Chat color plugin for Spigot/Paper

## Get The Plugin
The plugin is available for free on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/colorful-chat). There is a SpigotMC version, but it is no longer being updated due to not earning ad revenue there.

## Features
- Easy to use GUI with all Minecraft Colors
- Each player gets to chose their own color
- No complex setups or configs, just plug and play
- Works with a majority of chat formatters

## Usage
Colorful Chat is designed to be as easy as possible to use.
Any player with the permission `chatcolor.change` (default)
can use the command `/chatcolor` to open the GUI
and change their chat color. Players with the `chatcolor.custom`
can use `&` codes in their messages and the server will colorize it.
We recommend only giving `chatcolor.custom` to staff or trusted
players as the codes can be used to generate annoying messages
with lots of magic effects and bold text.

## Commands
- `/chatcolor [color]` - Opens the GUI to change your chat color, optionally if you provide a color in the args it will
change your color to that color
- Alias: `/cc`
- Permission: `chatcolor.change`

## Permissions
- `chatcolor.change` - Allows a player to change their chat color
- `chatcolor.custom` - Allows a player to use `&` codes in their messages

## Tested Chat Formatters
As long as your chat formatter is not modifying the chat message
everything should work just fine. I did test the plugin using
Vault prefixes, suffixes and such, and it worked as expected.

## Bugs
I am a solo developer who is in no way a professional programmer,
as such there are likely to be a lot of bugs that slipped through.
If you do find any bugs please make a report in our Discord server or on our GitHub Issues. Also, before you make a bug report make sure you are
running the latest version of the plugin.
